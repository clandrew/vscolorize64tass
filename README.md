# VSColorize65c816
This is a Visual Studio extension providing [64tass assembler-](http://tass64.sourceforge.net)compatible syntax highlighting for W65C816. This extension is in early alpha, created for personal convenience.

Notes:
* The opcode "INC" is not highlighted, because 64tass expects it to be written as "INA".
