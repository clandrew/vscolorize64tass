# VSColorize65c816
This is a Visual Studio extension providing [64tass assembler-](http://tass64.sourceforge.net)compatible syntax highlighting for W65C816. This extension was created for personal convenience and is in early alpha.

Language elements colorized:
* Mnemonics are highlighted as keywords
* Comments
* Strings
* Assembler directives

Notes:
* The opcode "INC" is not highlighted, because 64tass's convention is "INA".
